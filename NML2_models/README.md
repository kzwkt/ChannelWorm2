# ChannelWorm Models
This directory contains ion channel models which have been exported to the NeuroML2
format.  These models will ultimately be stored in PyOpenWorm so that they
can be accessed by c302 to simulate nervous system dynamics.

The folder annotated_PDF contains LaTeX files and PDFs with the identical
source code to the NML files in the top-level directory.  These are purely
for educational purposes.  Our goal is to have these files annotated so that
newcomers can better understand the NeuroML2 format. If you are a volunteer and would like to help
annotate these files, please look at the GitHub issues for relevant tasks.
